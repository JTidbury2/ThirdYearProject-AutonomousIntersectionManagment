# Third Year Project
This is the code that I developed throughout my third year project, the pdf of which is present in this repo.

`Enhancing Resilience in Multiagent Approaches to Autonomous Intersection Management`

It was made using 3 main pieces of code:
1. JavaSim - This is the original AIM simulator that my work is based on. It was eventually not used but rather used as a blueprint. The original work is present at: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~aim/ 
2. PettingZooSim - This is the Petting Zoo code that I used to train the Deep Reinforcement Learning agent used in my research. The inspiration for this work is found at: https://highway-env.farama.org 
3. PythonSim - This is the simulator used in my research. It is an extended version of the simulator found at: https://github.com/itstartstosnow/my_intersection_simulator

There is more documentation present in each of the directories. Any questions, feel free to reach out.
